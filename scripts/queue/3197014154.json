The app appears stuck until the new data finishes loading, then finally renders the dashboard again.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n**Current:**\nWhen navigating back from `/dashboard/revenue/archived` to `/dashboard`, the user does not see either:\n\n- the previously cached content or clear loading indicator.\n\nInstead, the UI keeping same until the delayed data finishes fetching.\n\n**Expected:**\nNavigating back should either:\n\ninstantly show the previous cached dashboard state (even stale) and then update when new data loads,\n\nor show at least the specific slot loaders again so the user understands data is loading.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.5.0: Tue Apr 22 19:54:25 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.121.6~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020\n  Available memory (MB): 16384\n  Available CPU cores: 10\nBinaries:\n  Node: 20.19.2\n  npm: 10.8.2\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\n  pnpm: 10.11.1\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.3.4 // Latest available version is detected (15.3.4).\n  eslint-config-next: 15.3.4\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.8.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
