Start the application in development\n2. Load the homepage\n3. Inspect cache-control header on versioned static assets in the browser tools\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n# Current behaviour\n\nNext sets `cache-control: public, max-age=10` for immutable assets in the `/_next/static` directory.\n\n<img width=\"1251\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27fc158f-124d-4a57-a043-8ce5af7de24c\" />\n\n# Expected behaviour\n\nNext should not allow overriding of `cache-control` headers for the `/_next/static` directory, as per the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/headers#cache-control)\n\n> Next.js sets the Cache-Control header of public, max-age=31536000, immutable for truly immutable assets. It cannot be overridden. These immutable files contain a SHA-hash in the file name, so they can be safely cached indefinitely. For example, [Static Image Imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/images#local-images). You cannot set Cache-Control headers in next.config.js for these assets.<br><br>However, you can set Cache-Control headers for other responses or data.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.5.0: Tue Apr 22 19:54:43 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.121.6~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T8132\n  Available memory (MB): 32768\n  Available CPU cores: 10\nBinaries:\n  Node: 22.9.0\n  npm: 10.8.3\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\n  pnpm: N/A\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.4.0-canary.93 // Latest available version is detected (15.4.0-canary.93).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.8.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
