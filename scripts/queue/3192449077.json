Add a redirect in `next.config.ts` where `destination` includes a hash like `https://www.example.com/#/login?return=something`, as in redirecting to an application using hash based routing, and the hash includes query params\n2. When triggering the redirect, Next fails with  `[TypeError: Unexpected MODIFIER at 8, expected END]`\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nRedirect should not fail with `?` in a hash\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: linux\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sun Aug  6 20:05:33 UTC 2023\n  Available memory (MB): 4102\n  Available CPU cores: 2\nBinaries:\n  Node: 20.9.0\n  npm: 9.8.1\n  Yarn: 1.22.19\n  pnpm: 8.10.2\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.4.0-canary.104 // Latest available version is detected (15.4.0-canary.104).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.3.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
