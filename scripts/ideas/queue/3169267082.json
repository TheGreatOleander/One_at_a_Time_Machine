Note path \"(...form)/[draftVer]/row\" is displayed\n5. Click \"Create\"\n6. Note \"Catch All\" is displayed (Expected \"(...form)/create\")\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n`(...form)/create` is not intercepting `form/create`\n\nWhen clicking the \"Create\" link on the I expect the `form/create` route to be intercepted by the `(...form)/create` path, but it actually caught by the catch all route. \n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: linux\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sun Aug  6 20:05:33 UTC 2023\n  Available memory (MB): 4102\n  Available CPU cores: 2\nBinaries:\n  Node: 20.12.0\n  npm: 10.5.0\n  Yarn: 1.22.19\n  pnpm: 8.15.6\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.4.0-canary.93 // Latest available version is detected (15.4.0-canary.93).\n  eslint-config-next: 15.2.0\n  react: 19.0.0\n  react-dom: 19.0.0\n  typescript: 5.8.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
