This causes unnecessary intermediate redirects.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\t1.\tGo to a URL like https://example.com////\n\t2.\tThe browser first redirects to https://example.com/\n\t3.\tThen, it redirects again to https://example.com (final destination without trailing slash)\n\nExpected behavior:\n\nNext.js should automatically handle URLs with multiple trailing slashes and redirect directly to the destination URL without any intermediate redirect.\n\nCurrent behavior:\n\nThe server first redirects from //// to /, and then to the final URL without the trailing slash. This results in unnecessary redirects.\n\nPossible solution:\n\nNext.js should implement a feature that detects multiple trailing slashes and redirects directly to the proper URL without any intermediate redirect.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nThis behavior may cause slower page loads due to multiple HTTP requests. It would be beneficial to add a feature to handle multiple slashes in a single redirect instead of chaining redirects.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nCurrent behavior:\n\nWhen a URL with multiple trailing slashes (e.g. ////) is accessed, the server first redirects to a URL with a single trailing slash (e.g. /). After that, a second redirect occurs to the final destination URL without the trailing slash (e.g. https://example.com). This results in two unnecessary redirects (301) instead of one.\n\nExample:\n\t•\tURL: https://example.com////\n\t•\tStep 1: Redirect to https://example.com/ (single slash).\n\t•\tStep 2: Redirect to https://example.com (final URL without trailing slash).\n\n⸻\n\nExpected behavior:\n\nWhen a URL with multiple trailing slashes (e.g. ////) is accessed, Next.js should directly redirect to the final destination URL without any intermediate redirect (e.g. https://example.com). There should be no extra redirects or steps involved.\n\nExample:\n\t•\tURL: https://example.com////\n\t•\tExpected behavior: Directly redirect to https://example.com.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nNext.js: v15.4.0-canary.102 (June 2025)\nNode.js: v20.9.0 (October 2023)\nnpm: v11.4.2 (June 2025)\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
