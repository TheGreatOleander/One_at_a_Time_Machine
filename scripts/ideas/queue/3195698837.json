This docs would let me think that `cache()` is therefore not needed. But in fact it is with POST and I had to wrap my fetch with `cache()` function to benefit from memoization. \n\n------\n\nThe [APIs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/caching#apis) section (the table) specifies that `fetch` is \"Cache\" under \"React Cache\". This part will benefit from specifying \"(GET method)\" underneath. This could be similar to \"(Server Action)\" specification underneath `revalidateTag`. \n\n------\n\nThe section [Request Memoization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/caching#request-memoization) correctly says in multiple places that it's only GET method that automatically benefits. I think this should serve as a great example.\n\nOther than that the guide is really good, thank you! :) \n\n\n### Is there any context that might help us understand?\n\nI think it's very clear. I mentioned my GraphQL fetch case above in the description.\n\n### Does the docs page already exist? Please link to it.\n\nhttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/caching","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/81183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/81183/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1.0}
