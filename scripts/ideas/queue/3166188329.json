If the page does many requests, the user sees a blank page, or a hanging link, for the entire time\n\nExpected behavior: initial compilation should stream in and show suspense states, to give a better UX to users. Further requests can then of course use the compiled HTML (that doesn't contain suspense) \n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.5.0: Tue Apr 22 19:48:46 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.121.6~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T8103\n  Available memory (MB): 16384\n  Available CPU cores: 8\nBinaries:\n  Node: 23.11.0\n  npm: 10.9.2\n  Yarn: N/A\n  pnpm: N/A\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.4.0-canary.91 // Latest available version is detected (15.4.0-canary.91).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 18.3.1\n  react-dom: 18.3.1\n  typescript: N/A\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
