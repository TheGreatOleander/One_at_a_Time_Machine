Install the latest canary version in https://github.com/vercel/next-app-router-playground project.\n2. Edit `next.config.ts` to include sourcemaps using webpack:\n```const nextConfig = {\n  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],\n  experimental: {\n    inlineCss: true,\n    dynamicIO: true,\n    clientSegmentCache: true,\n    viewTransition: true,\n    prerenderEarlyExit: false,\n    routerBFCache: true,\n  },\n  webpack: (config) => {\n    config.devtool = 'source-map';\n    return config;\n  },\n} satisfies NextConfig;\n```\n3. Run `pnpm build`\n4. In `.next/server/app/context` you will find `page.js` and `page.js.map`\n5. Use some kind of sourcemap resolver, I used https://evanw.github.io/source-map-visualization/\n6. On line 2, column 14664 you will see the parameter named `a` which should be resolved to `product`, but it doesn't resolve to a name (it almost points to the correct location in the sourcemap, but it doesn't have a name).\n\n<img width=\"1501\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2346ad38-2741-44cb-8ad9-8ca343efc43f\" />\n\n\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nMost of the sourcemaps are correct, but in some cases looks like they are off a little and aren't resolving to the actual value.\nIn this case, the parameter should be resolved to `product` but it doesn't resolve to anything.\nThere are more cases on multiple projects I have tested on, and more scenarios other than parameters (functions, objects, etc). If it's needed I can provide more examples.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 23.4.0: Fri Mar 15 00:10:42 PDT 2024; root:xnu-10063.101.17~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\n  Available memory (MB): 32768\n  Available CPU cores: 10\nBinaries:\n  Node: 18.20.2\n  npm: 10.5.0\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\n  pnpm: 10.11.0\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.4.0-canary.86 // Latest available version is detected (15.4.0-canary.86).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.7.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
